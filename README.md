# Unity Construction Blueprints in the style of The Forest <br>using the Scan-Line Algorithm

This is my version of a custom floor generation inspired by The Forest. <br>
The scan-line algorithm is a popular method for filling the interior of a closed polygon in computer graphics. It works by traversing the polygon edges and determining which pixels on the screen should be filled based on their position relative to the polygon. <br>
In this project, i used an adapted scan-line algorithm that fills the surface of the polygon with 3d game objects as floor elements instead of pixels. <br>
Usage: press B to initiate the construction mode and then press 2 for the custom floor. <br><br>
Useful resources for the scan-line algorithm: <br>
